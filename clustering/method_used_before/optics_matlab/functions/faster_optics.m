%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%function for optics clustering of input 2d data
%improved version over the normal optics function

%INPUTS
% - data (2d data in the form of Nx2 where N is the number of data points)
% - Nmin (minimal number of points to form a cluster)
% - eps (maximum distance to check the Nmin parameter)

%OUTPUTS
% - orderedList (output indexing of the input data)
% - reachDistList (final reachability distance for every data point)
% - coreDistList (core distance for every data point)
% - procesList (if every data point was processed should be array of ones)

% to get the final reachabilty distance array with correct indexing use code simmilar to following 
%  for i = 1:size(data,1)
%     orderedReachList(i,1) = reachDistList(orderedList(i));
